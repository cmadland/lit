#### Abstract
This article explores the shortcomings of conventional validity theory for guiding classroom assessment practice and suggests additional theoretical resources from sociocultural theory and hermeneutics to complement and challenge conventional theory. To illuminate these concerns and possibilities in a concrete context, the author uses her own classroom experience in teaching a qualitative research methods course. The importance of examining cases of assessment practice in context for developing, teaching, and evaluating validity theory is discussed.

Keywords: classroom assessment, hermeneutics, sociocultural theory, validity

## Key Ideas

> The question I consider in this article is to what extent does our understanding of validity in the measurement profession “assure that the relevant issues are addressed in classroom assessment and what role might other theoretical perspectives play in providing a more robust validity framework to guide thinking and action?

#### Assumptions of validity theory and alternative perspectives

The following assumptions are considered:
- Assessment is a discrete activity.
- The focus of validity theory is on an assessment-based interpretation and use.
- The unit of analysis for an assessment is the individual.
- Interpretations are constructed by aggregating discrete pieces of evidence to form an interpretable overall score.
- Consequences are an aspect of validity if they can be traced to a source of construct under-representation or construct irrelevant variance (cf. AERA et al., 1999; Messick, 1989).

Psychometric characterizations of learning infer learning from observed changes in individuals' performances over time.
- changes are internal to the learner
- vertical hierarchy of increasingly generalized and abstract skills and knowledge

Sociocultural perspective suggests that learning is perceived through changing relationships among the learner, other human participants, and the material and symbolic tools available.
- not just a new skill, but a new identity and social position w/i the discourse or CoP
- learning changes who we are by changing our ability to participate and belong (Wenger, 1998)

Author's thinking about validity informed by interpretive social sciens, esp philosophical hermeneutics. Like psychometrics, hermeneutics interprets human products, expressions or actions by combining information across data sources and evidence [`assessment as research`].

- In psychmetrics, scores on independent tests are weighted and aggregated to form an overall grade,
- in hermeneutics, evidence is gathered holistically and integrated with interpreting human phenomena, seeks to understand the whole in light of its parts, repeatedly tests interpretations against available evidence until each part can be accounted for in an integrated whole.
  - known as hermeneutic circle
  - evidence is used to illuminate and challenge bias

#### One case of classroom assessment Practice

- *Qualitative Methods in Educational research* co-designed and taught with Lesley Rex
- different perspectives contribute to validity b/c they can challenge each other's biases
