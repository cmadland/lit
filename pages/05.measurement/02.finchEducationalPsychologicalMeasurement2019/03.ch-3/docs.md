## Classical Test Theory

> At the heart of CTT is the idea of the true score for the construct we are measuring (e.g., math achievement) and its relationship with the observed score on a test.

- the observed test score
- true score for an individual
- random variability in the observed score caused by factors other than true ability (fatigue, stress)

!! The framework can't be falsified b/c the relationship can be understood conceptually but can't be formally tested using observed data.

`Error` must be understood as it is central to understanding the framework.
1. random error - specific to a time, place, examinee, or assessment, and balanced over the 4 factors
2. systematic error - consistent across one or more of time, place, examinee, and assessment - leads to biased (upward or downward) observed scores

### True score and its components

Core of CTT is the equation

`X = T + E`

Where  
`X` = the observed score on the scale  
`T` = the true score on the scale  
`E` = error

(Equation 3.1, p. 30)

###### Example
- When we obtain a score on a math test (X<sub>i</sub>), we are really interested in the `true score` (T<sub>i</sub>).
- T<sub>i</sub> represents the mean of a theoretical distribution of observed scores after repeated and independent assessments on the same test an infinite number of times.
- we *infer* T<sub>i</sub> using X<sub>i</sub> because we cannot test over and over again.  
- T is the expected value (population mean) of X, where the population is the scores from the student.
- if a student scores 91 on a math test, the score (X<sub>i</sub>) shows how much the students knows, measured on an imperfect test.
  - the score will be used to infer the student's understanding of math, T<sub>i</sub>, based on a single sample from the population of theoretically possible scores from the population.
  - ... the teacher needs to rely on the next best thing, the observed score
