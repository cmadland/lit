### Abstract

The act of instruction may be conceptualized as consisting of four elements: learning outcomes, learning resources, teaching and learning activities, and assessments and evaluation. For instructors in higher education, the way they manage the relationships between these elements is what could be considered the core of their instructional practice. For each of the elements, this paper seeks to identify open educational practices, their affordances, and evidence of their utility in supporting the work of teachers in shifting from existing teaching and learning practices to more open educational practices. The literature reviewed and model proposed may provide educational developers or proponents of open education a lens with which to discuss open educational practices with faculty specifically related to their teaching and learning design practices.

#### Defining Open Education Practice

> While some literature has suggested OEP are simply those which make use of OER, one of the founding documents on open education suggests a broader vision. The Cape Town Open Education Declaration suggests,

> > “open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning” (The Cape Town Open Education Declaration, 2007, para. 4).

The differences in the 'open' movement in Europe and North America are interesting in that the *OEP* and *open pedagogy* stream has been much more active in Europe, whereas *OER* have been at the forefront in North America. A large part of this has been due to the amount of private and government funding available in NA for the creation of OER. So OER have become somewhat of the thin edge of the wedge making room for further innovation in higher ed.

> Based on these attempts to articulate OEP and a desire to have a definition which more specifically addresses how faculty might make the shift from existing practices to open practices, a working definition in the context of this research is proposed.

!!!! Teaching and learning practices where openness is enacted within all aspects of instructional practice; including the design of learning outcomes, the selection of teaching resources, and the planning of activities and assessment. OEP engage both faculty and students with the use and creation of OER, draw attention to the potential afforded by open licences, facilitate open peer-review, and support participatory student-directed projects.

I think that the focus on all aspects of instructional practice is important here. The focus of OER in NA has led to openness being enacted primarily in the selection of learning resources, leaving the rest untouched. This happens when a 'bolt-on' approach is taken or a faculty member simply replaces a commercial textbook with an open one.

The idea of participatory student-directed projects is the crux of the matter, I think. Students *learn* what students *do.* Inviting them into the life of the university by including them in real, meaningful participation and contribution is critical.

#### The Atomic Structure of Instructional Practice

> Considering OEP within a framework which supports pedagogically sound instructional design practices makes it more straightforward to identify specific, relevant, roles for integrating OER and enacting OEP (Masterman, 2016). An analysis of the literature on OEP follows considering these four core elements of constructive alignment.

##### Open Practices for the Design of Learning Outcomes

!!! Ehlers, U.-D. (2011). Extending the Territory: From Open Educational Resources to Open Educational Practices. Journal of Open, Flexible, and Distance Learning, 15(2), 1–10.

- Low degrees of openness are reflected in learning outcomes where transmission and reproduction of knowledge is the intended goal. `transmission model` 
- Medium degrees of openness might be said to exist when learning outcomes are predetermined, but the pedagogy is flexible and students are actively involved in collective dialogue. `transaction model`
- High degrees of openness would involve co-creation of the learning outcomes, objectives, and methods by students. `transformational model`

The idea of learning outcomes as artefacts of open practices is new to me, but it follows from why I choose to be more open. Exposing my work to the web makes it available for improvement.
