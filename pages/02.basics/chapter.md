### Hey there!

Welcome to my

# Article Database

This site is a repository of articles I've reviewed as I work towards my PhD in Educational Technology at the University of Victoria.

I've built this site *for me*, but you may find it helpful too. If you'd like to contribute, hit the 'Edit in GitHub' button at the top and start a Pull Request.
