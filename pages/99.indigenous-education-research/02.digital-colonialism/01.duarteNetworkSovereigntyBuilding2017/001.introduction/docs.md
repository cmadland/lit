I based this work on the following risky ideas:

- Human beings are also herd animals.
- Human beings are inherently creative.
- The present-day use of the word technology is laden with present-day beliefs about progress, scientific and ethical advance through com puting, and the superhuman conquest of time, space, history, and environment.
- The large-scale forces of Western European modernities have resulted in the creation of a global class of humans referred to as “natives,” “aboriginals,” or “indigenous” persons.
- Various fields of science are at present dominated by those who believe that techno-scientific advance must come from a Western European history of ideas and not from, for example, Tsalagi histories of ideas, Hiaki histories of ideas, A:Shiwi histories of ideas, Anishinaabe histories of ideas, Chamoru histories of ideas, and the like. (pp. x-xi)

> Moreover, I studied networks and the technical systems through which they physically manifest, with an eye toward Silko’s prophetic reading: What are the technologies that will allow us, as Indigenous peoples, to reclaim our lands and ways of being—spiritually, socially, spatially, ecologically, and politically? (p. 4-5)
