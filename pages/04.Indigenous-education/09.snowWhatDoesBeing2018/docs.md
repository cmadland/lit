### Abstract

Research with Indigenous peoples is fraught with complexity and misunderstandings. The complexity of negotiating historical and current issues as well as the misunderstandings about what the issues really mean for individuals and communities can cause non-Indigenous researchers to shy away from working with Indigenous groups. In conducting research for my doctoral dissertation, I was a novice researcher faced with negotiating two very different sets of social contracts: the Western Canadian university?s and my Indigenous participants?. Through narrative inquiry of my experience, this article explores issues of ethics, institutional expectations, and community relationships. Guided by Kirkness and Barnhardt?s ?Four R?s? framework of respect, relevance, reciprocity, and responsibility, I aimed to meet the needs of both the groups, but it was not without challenges. What do you do when needs collide? This article shares my process of negotiating the research, the decisions made, and how I came to understand my role in the process as a Settler Ally. It closes with some implications for other researchers who are considering their own roles as Settler Allies.

### Key quotes and ideas
> Novice non-Indigenous researchers may question their legitimacy in engaging in research with Indigenous communities because of historical and current issues faced by both non-Indigenous and Indigenous peoples in Canada.

> Historically, research by non-Indigenous researchers was conducted on rather than with Indigenous populations.

> In particular, in Canada—where the trauma of residential schools and the road to recovery has only just begun—any researcher thinking about working with Indigenous groups in Canada must acknowledge our past and the damage our research has historically done when placed in the hands of colonial thinkers. In the past, many researchers worked from a deficit perspective with the aim of resolving Indigenous problems. This practice endures.

Snow begins with an anecdote about her own expereinces growing up in Nunavut (above the treeline) when a southern researcher showed up in town to investigate growing trees. The researcher came, planted his trees, set up fences, and left. Children in the community, in clear view of their bemused parents and other adults, took great delight in devising new ways to circumvent his attempts to keep them from damaging his trees. In the end, the children triumphed and the researcher left without so much as a sniff at any useful data for his project, but with a robust lesson in community-based research.

Snow's sense of duty was grounded in the TRC's call to Settler and Indigenous Canadians to ensure that Indigenous peoples are able to hold their equitable place in Canadian society. But while this call, epitomized by Chief Justice Murray Sinclair's statement

!!! Reconcilliation is not an Aboriginal problem – it involves all of us. (Antoine, Mason, Mason, Palahicky, & Rodriguez de France, 2018)
