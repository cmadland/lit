### Abstract

Research with Indigenous peoples is fraught with complexity and misunderstandings. The complexity of negotiating historical and current issues as well as the misunderstandings about what the issues really mean for individuals and communities can cause non-Indigenous researchers to shy away from working with Indigenous groups. In conducting research for my doctoral dissertation, I was a novice researcher faced with negotiating two very different sets of social contracts: the Western Canadian university?s and my Indigenous participants?. Through narrative inquiry of my experience, this article explores issues of ethics, institutional expectations, and community relationships. Guided by Kirkness and Barnhardt?s ?Four R?s? framework of respect, relevance, reciprocity, and responsibility, I aimed to meet the needs of both the groups, but it was not without challenges. What do you do when needs collide? This article shares my process of negotiating the research, the decisions made, and how I came to understand my role in the process as a Settler Ally. It closes with some implications for other researchers who are considering their own roles as Settler Allies.
### Keywords:
Indigenous research methodologies, qualitative interviews, ethics, settler ally

### Key quotes and ideas
> Novice non-Indigenous researchers may question their legitimacy in engaging in research with Indigenous communities because of historical and current issues faced by both non-Indigenous and Indigenous peoples in Canada.

> Historically, research by non-Indigenous researchers was conducted on rather than with Indigenous populations.

> In particular, in Canada—where the trauma of residential schools and the road to recovery has only just begun—any researcher thinking about working with Indigenous groups in Canada must acknowledge our past and the damage our research has historically done when placed in the hands of colonial thinkers. In the past, many researchers worked from a deficit perspective with the aim of resolving Indigenous problems. This practice endures.

Snow begins with an anecdote about her own expereinces growing up in Nunavut (above the treeline) when a southern researcher showed up in town to investigate growing trees. The researcher came, planted his trees, set up fences, and left. Children in the community, in clear view of their bemused parents and other adults, took great delight in devising new ways to circumvent his attempts to keep them from damaging his trees. In the end, the children triumphed and the researcher left without so much as a sniff at any useful data for his project, but with a robust lesson in community-based research.

Snow's sense of duty was grounded in the TRC's call to Settler and Indigenous Canadians to ensure that Indigenous peoples are able to hold their equitable place in Canadian society. But while this call, epitomized by Chief Justice Murray Sinclair's statement

!!! Reconciliation is not an Aboriginal problem – it involves all of us. (Antoine, Mason, Mason, Palahicky, & Rodriguez de France, 2018)

seems straightforward, the realities of non-Indigenous people researching Indigenous contexts are deeply complex and nuanced. Indigenous peoples have been the objects of research for too long, and the calls from the TRC that all Canadians need to engage in the process of reconciliation has resulted in a flood of funding and interest from Settler Canadians, an outcome that may not be welcomed by Indigenous communities.

### Identifying the Complexity and My Position in It

3 main concerns
> - the legitimization of Indigenous research methodologies developed by and for Indigenous people,
- concerns around the ability for non-Indigenous researchers to work respectfully in Indigenous communities, and
- the appropriateness of non-Indigenous researchers’ adoption of Indigenous research methods.

### Arguing for Legitimacy of Indigenous Research Methods

> Indigenous researchers are leading the way by defining research methodologies from Indigenous epistemologies that better reflect cultural norms of Indigenous peoples and disrupt the balance of power in researcher–participant relationships

Despite the continuing work of Indigenous researchers to outline and define methodologies in alignment with Indigenous values and epistemologies, Western academics tend to be reticent to recognize the legitimacy of Indigenous methods and epistemologies for 'serious' academic work.

> Some of my approaches were too far removed from the accepted boundaries of “academic research,” and I was not in a position to defend myself: As a non-Indigenous student, I had neither the legitimacy of ancestry nor the experience of polished academics to advocate for my approach.

### Questioning My Own Legitimacy and Intentions

Some researchers argue that, due to the history of colonialism and assimilation in North America, that only Indigenous people may legitimately conduct research with Indigenous people.

### Negotiating the Space Between Legitimacy and Appropriation Toward a Research Question

Snow writes about approaching her friend and colleague, the Director of Indigenous programming at her school, for advice and finding that their dialogues in the context of a real friendship was foundational to her research. It was the director who introduced her to members of the campus community and set the direction for her research with her knowledge of the challenges faced by their 1-year Pre-Nursing Transitions (PNT) program designed to support Indigenous students.

They co-developed a research question:

!!! What aspects of the 1-year PNT Program were effective in supporting student persistence, and what, from a student perspective, could be changed to support student success?

The university had lots of quan data related to retention, attrition and graduation rates, but a more holistic approach was necessary to honour student persistence and success.

### Developing a Methodological Approach

There aren't any 'how-to' manuals for Indigenous research methodologies. Wilson (2008) describes research as 'ceremony and a journey of self-discovery and reflection'.

> [Wilson] offered some hope for me, as I considered my own questions about personal legitimacy; he stated that one does not have to be Indigenous to adopt an Indigenous research paradigm, but that one does have to shift one’s ontology and practice, focusing on local and contextually derived knowledge rather than on published literature.

Snow needed to acknowledge the role of Canadian history on Settler and Indigenous relationships, so the program director suggested she begin to develop relationships with the students by offering a workshop on research. She noticed some skepticism and mistrust, so when she came with her own research proposal, it was tentative and negotiable.

Battiste (2013) suggests at minimum, researchers acknowledge the power differential between non-Indigenous researchers and Indigenous populations.
