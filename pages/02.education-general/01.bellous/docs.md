##### Resistance and Integrity

> I propose that both the formal and informal aspects of teaching should inspire students to practice resistance that is directed towards the development of authenticity and agency. (p. 3)

> The frrst is that our pedagogic prac- tices should support rather than contradict our formal assertions about what we value in the teaching-learning relation. By this, I mean we should do what we say. (p. 3)
> The second path teachers might take is to assert that student involvement is not permitted, giving students their reasons, and informal teaching practices would support non-participation. (p. 4)

> Despite our beliefs about Canadian society and the teach- ing environment, I suggest it is common for students to experience a failure of pedagogic integrity; that is, they experience the pedagogic hypocrisy of our saying one thing and doing another and the practice of signalling that student participation is not important while giving them no good reasons for silencing them. Pedagogic hypocrisy opens the door to a "culture of silence," as described by Freire and Shor; this is a culture that works against the develop- ment of skill in democratic conversation. (p. 4)

> FoucauJt suggests that the possibility of domination is a constant threat to the we11-being of the teaching-learning relation, but that power can be exercised according to practices of freedom that limit domination. (p. 5)

> Violence also grounds the model that Shor uses when he describes classroom realities as he sees them. He asserts that:
>> There is a "symbolic violence" in school and society which imposes silence on students. It is symbolic because it is in the very order of things, not an actual physical beating, but an environment of rules, curriculum, tests, punishments, requirements, correction, remediation, and standard English, which establishes the authorities as the ones in charge. The environment is symbolically violent because it is based in manipulation and subordination. It openly declares itself "democratic" while actually constructing and reproducing inequality....For individual students, it becomes hard to see alternatives to "the way things are and have to be." (p. 5)

>I would say that if we picture resistance as constituted in an atmosphere of violence, we cannot make good educational use of its practices. Empowerment provides a better model for teaching because empowerment is grounded on a view of power that suggests models for power relations that have everything to do with maturity and partnership. (p. 5)

> In order to distinguish between resistance grounded in violence and resis- tance as a companion to empowerment, we must pick out the differences be- tween power and empowerment. (p. 6)

> When we use "empowerment," its root word picks out an entirely dif- ferent exercise of power in social relations. Here power is not a scarce material resource, nor is it the redistribution of a commodity that leaves some people out. Power is a kind of social energy which has no limit and is relational not material. I f A empowers B, then personal power is created in B and is neither diminished nor exaggerated in A. (p. 6)

##### Resistance and Trust
> The second reason that formal and informal aspects of teaching should teach students to resist is connected to the building of trust that becomes pos- sible in pedagogic integrity; that is, the congruence between what we say and do as teachers. If students learn to resist in the context of pedagogic integrity, they can trust that what we say is what they will get in formal pedagogic programs as well as in informal classroom practices. (p. 7)

> Under these conditions, resistance takes the form of posing authentic questions; in addition, resistance is free to take the form of listening to reasons given and assessing these reasons in light of democratic ideals and challenging these reasons openly when they do not match up with the knowledge and perspective of the learner in the teaching- learning relation. I am not assuming that students will be good at these question-posing, listening, and assessing skills at first; rather, it is what they have to learn through practice. (p. 7)

> Regardless of their skill, trust in the context of pedagogic integrity produces an environment in which resistance can come to be educative because it is exercised with rather than over or against others. (p. 7)

!!! > Passivity and submissiveness in the presence of hypocrisy and oppression do not foster creativity and they frustrate the development of trust and human maturity. (p. 7)

##### Resistance and the art of voice

> The central and unifying aim of empowerment is human maturity. The goal of empowerment is the realization of the mature, creative individual who practices personal power and encourages it in others; the development of human agency and authenticity is central to maturity, partnership, and participatory democracy. (p. 8)

> Voice refers to the articulation of critical opinion aimed at making our legitimate interests known; voice is direct and straightforward as opposed to protest that is a private, secret vote.17 Voice refers to any attempt to change, rather than escape from an objectionable state of affairs through working collec- tively or individually.18 Voice implies being able to sense and say what we want and to provide others with our reasons. In terms of personal power, the art of voice conveys to others the plans and purposes we have for ourselves. (p. 8)

##### Practising Education
>In order to distinguish the oppositional practices that seem necessary in the face of domination and violence from the cooperational practices that are possible in an empowering pedagogic relationship (in which we express resis- tance to secure authenticity and agency), I want to identify three types of school and home practices that are influential in determining how students turn out. These practices may be coercive, laissez-faire, or empowering.

>Coercive practices can be identified by their characteristic dependence on force, whether this is epistemological force (through deception), psychological force (through threatening talk or behaviour), or physical force (through violence). (p. 9)

>Laissez-faire practices are sometimes taken up by those who are appalled by coercive practices but who have not been sufficiently reflective about the limitations inherent in the practices they feel compelled to use. In taissez-faire practices, students are given all the power and the adult abnegates his or her right to exercise power over students, a pattern which may also structure the relationship between parents and children. (p. 9)

>In contrast to the first two types, empowering practices can lead children and students into mature, responsible, and responsive relationships with their social world. Empowerment results in the development of personal power and is grounded in reciprocity and respect. If coercive practices have force at their core, and if laissez-faire practices have neglect at their core, attentiveness is at the core of empowering practices. (p. 10)

##### Summary

>The virtue of empowering educative resistance is grounded in a student's ability to sense and articulate good reasons for resisting something. (p. 11)

>Students who enjoy empowering pedagogic relationships are capable of respecting others and themselves and develop skills necessary to participatory democracy. Such students would be good at resisting bureaucratic practices that promote passivity and submissiveness to the will of others in the absence of any good reasons. It is entirely possible that the partial resistance inherent in em- powerment would be a nuisance in bureaucratic schools. So much the better for education. (p. 11)



#### Discussion

I deeply appreciate Bellous' view expressed in this article. I look back with regret at some of the instances where I acted with coercive power over students in my classes due to the bureaucratic structure of the system. I think that this system is a large part of why I left K12 teaching.

The problem, though, with raising children empowered to resist is that they tend to grow up and make their own decisions, and if you have spent their entire lives teaching them to exercise their voice, you can't really go back on that when the start using their voice in a way that you think is not ideal. 


#### Conclusion
