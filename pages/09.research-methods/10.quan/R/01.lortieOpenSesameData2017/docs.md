> if we want the next generation to make informed, evidence-based decisions about human health, the economy, and the health of our ecosystems. We need to understand data directlyâ€”its potential value as an evidence asset, but also its challenges. Critical thinking tools for data are nontrivial concepts, and statistics are absolutely needed. (p. 1)

> Open science is a movement that promotes sharing the process and not just the final product of evidence-based inquiry common in science (Wolkovich, Regetz, and O'Connor 2012, Michener and Jones 2012). (p. 1)

> quantitative and qualitative data. This should be transparent and reinforced in both teaching and communicating science. However, the science of data, big or little, is critical in appreciating the decisions, steps, and workflow needed to prepare, share, analyze, collaborate, and evaluate (p. 1)

> The decisions involved in data science are important and frame the conclusions and implications for a particular body of evidence. The key elements often include transparency, reproducibility, and access. (p. 2)

> The capacity to publish a book using the same tools that one can use to wrangle, visualize, and analyze data is a profound innovation. Access to books published using these tools, then shared on GitHub, is a new form of publishing. (p. 2)

> The book was officially published Decem- 12th, ber 2016 in print form. However, because it was available online as a knitted book, it could be read as it developed and evolved, and, the authors capitalized on the versioning workflow, transparency, and collaborative philosophy of many data scientists, while soliciting specific feedback on sections in writing. (p. 2)

> Welcome to the tidyverse. Enough said to all who follow and read up within the R community (https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse). This universe is logical and feels natural. Tidy data are data frames with a specific structure; namely, variables are organized by columns, observations by rows, and each cell is a value (Wickham 2014, Grolemund and Wickham 2016). (p. 3)

> Subscribing to the philosophy of readable code, consistent data structures, and logical workflows will promote better open science and reproducibility. (p. 3)

> The best data science is certainly open science, and open science should not be a static one-way process. The capacity for RStudio connected to GitHub to allow versioning is thus an immediate mechanism to make use of R as a bridge between data science and open science (Figure 2). (p. 4)

> Figure 2. The coding language and environment R can be a literal bridge between data science and open science. In the book 'R for Data Science', the capacity for R as foundation to incorporate transparency, reproducibility, and access into processes associated with data science are well described and illuminate capacities for novel, open scientific communication.
