### Abstract

This article is about context, power located within institutions, and complexities of interpretation tightly twisted in a participatory action research project with women in prison. This narrative speaks to the encounter between us and the women, the unfamiliarity each of us had with the other's language, and the joint challenge to 'decode' transcripts of incarcerated women's voices. As action researchers we were determined, indeed even smugly pleased, to be undertaking this venture of tutelage, of introducing the women as co-researchers to methods of data analysis. However, we watched a shifting of power (empowerment), as the women became the true researchers through their proximity to and conversations with the transcripts as raw realities, narratives that acknowledged their lives, which we knew only as data. In the end, we came away unsettled, with deeper awareness for the complexity of interpreting 'data', which constitutes local knowing, the unsaid, and the unspeakable.

### EDCP 512A - Discussion 1a

Read by attending to the language used, the style in terms of how the story is shared, how the researchers draw upon and make use of the literature, the positionality of the researchers (that is, the relationship of the researchers and participants), the nature of the research project.

####  What is the position of the researcher(s) and the participants? What is the relationship of the researcher(s) and participant(s)?

Researchers - power & authority on research and in society, relatively high prestige position in society, power and authority are inherent in their position, and yet, very low power and authority w/i prison hierarchy

Participants - very low societal status, power, or authority, yet in the context of the prison system, they have higher power and authority due to familiarity with customs and hierarchies (community knowledge)

When R enter P context, they must recognize that they give up power and authority. The relationship necessarily changes.

> As Grant, Nelson and Mitchell (2008) remind us, the power differential between researchers and participants and the value assigned to community knowledge are critical factors in the interpretation and co-creation of knowledge. These authors insist that relinquishing control while maintaining integrity means, “respect for the community’s knowledge that requires researcher humility” (p. 598). (p. 271)

#### Who is posing the problem and whose research question is it?

Problem and RQ are initially the researchers' and were related to health of women in prison.

> Our intentions of good research practice were interrupted as we are challenged to reconsider what it means to ‘interpret’ transcripts. *[We bring in the research gaze, imagining that we would decode the transcripts together through known methods of analysis. Instead, the women call us to listen as they respond to each transcript as if in conversation with the absent women whose words are contained within the text.] (p. 271)*

> However, introducing PAR into incarceration settings seems an obvious choice as Kemmis and McTaggart (2005) remind us:
>>“ . . . . PAR aims to help people recover and release themselves from the constraints of the irrational, unproductive, unjust, and unsatisfying social structures that limit their self development and self-determination” (p. 567-568). (p. 273)

Over time, the women begin to articulate their own questions.

> The initial research question expanded as those of us on the research team outside the correctional centre began to translate our research curiosity to their institutional needs and personal desires. Their questions were: *What are the barriers that stop women in prison from successful integration into society? What do we need so that we stop coming back?* The “we” referred to the inmates themselves and addressed the high percentage that return to prison within a few years. (p. 274)


#### What is the value of this study (the author(s)’ conclusion and your critical opinion)

Studying the health of women in prison with the aim to improve conditions is good, but perhaps the greater value in the study was the transformation of the researchers as they came to realize their own institutionalized biases.

> More unsettling, we began to question our own understanding of interpretation as it shifted from being something doable to becoming complex, elusive, and other-directed, slipping out of our control into an in-between space of encounter between the women participants and the transcripts, and ourselves. (p. 275)

They then jump right in to the panopticon...

> The gaze is alert everywhere. (Foucault, 1977, p. 195)

Our privileged 'saviour' complex runs deep.

> We were in a correctional institution that seeks to “reform” incarcerated women, but rarely engages or consults them in meaningful ways as co-agents of change. (p. 276)

However, how different are the contexts of the university and the prison, really?

> Throughout this project, it was continually brought to our attention, as researchers and prisoners engaged in a participatory action research model, that we were operating in the margins of normal institutional behavior—that of the correctional centre, and that of the university. However, it was undeniable that the positionality of our mutual locations impacted our encounter. Both institutions undertake surveillance, both operate as gatekeepers, within an “economy of power,” which fabricates the norm and enforces it (Foucault, 1977, p. 303) (p. 277-278)

### A question this article raises WRT education action research.

On p. 275 of the article, Meyer and Fels quote Foucault

> The gaze is alert everywhere. (Foucault, 1977, p. 195)

It strikes me as important that the authors choose to invoke Bentham's idea of the *panopticon* in what appears (to this point of my reading) to be a critique of the very idea of researchers having at their disposal, the power of the panopticon. That they can be the unobserved observer.

What does it mean to let go of the idea that university researchers can be detached? Why is this parallel between university research and the panopticon so striking?

> Fine and Torre (2008) so eloquently express,
> . . . our work is nested within institutions, and typically launched from the perspective of those with the least power, our research collectives must continually revisit questions of the research purpose — *for whom* is the work and *toward what ends?* (p. 408) (p. 271)
