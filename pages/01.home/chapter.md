### Hey there!

Welcome to my article database.

This site is a repository of articles I've reviewed as I work towards my PhD in Educational Technology at the University of Victoria.

I'm building this site *for me*, but you may find it helpful too. If you'd like to contribute, hit 'Edit this page' button at the top and start a Pull Request in GitHub.
