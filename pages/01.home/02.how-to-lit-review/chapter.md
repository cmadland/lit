Definition:

A literature review is an assessment of a body of research that addresses a research question.

Purpose:

 A literature review:

    Identifies what is already known about an area of study

It may also:

    Identify questions a body of research does not answer     
    Make a case for why further study of research questions is important to a field

Process:

It is a research journey with several steps:

    Framing a research question
    Searching relevant bodies of literature
    Managing search results
    Synthesizing the research literature
    Writing an assessment of the literature

The process is iterative—as you gain understanding, you’ll return to earlier steps to rethink, refine, and rework your literature review.
