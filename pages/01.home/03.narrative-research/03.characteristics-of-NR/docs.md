## 4 key terms

#### *Living* stories
Put simply, people live their own stories. Each person's present story is influenced by their past experiences, contexts, cultures, families, beliefs, and myriad other influences, so each person's story is utterly unique.

#### *Telling* stories
As people live, they also tell their stories to others.

#### *Retelling* stories
As researchers come alongside people and inquire into their stories, the peoples' stories are retold, but this time with the addition of the researcher's stories.

#### *Reliving* stories
As researchers and participants are both changed in the retelling of their stories, both may begin to relive their stories.
