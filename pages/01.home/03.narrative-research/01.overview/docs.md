#### Definition

"Study of experience when experience is understood as lived and told stories. It is a collaboration between researcher and participants, over time, in a place or series of places and in social interaction with their social milieus" (Johnson & Christensen, 2017)
`Need Date`

Narrative inquiry is based on Dewey's two criteria of experience:
- continuity, or the idea that a person's experiences are shaped by their past experiences and that they shape future experiences;
- interaction between a person and their environment
