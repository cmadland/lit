### Abstract

All research is guided by a set of philosophical underpinnings. Indigenous methodologies are in line with an Indigenous paradigm, while critical and liberatory methodologies fit with the transformative paradigm. Yet Indigenous and transformative methodologies share an emancipatory and critical stance and thus are increasingly used in tandem by both Western and Indigenous scholars in an attempt to decolonize methodologies, research, and the academy as a whole. However, these multiparadigmatic spaces only superficially support decolonization which, in the Canadian context of settler colonialism, is a radical and unsettling prospect that is about land, resources, and sovereignty. Applying this definition of decolonization to the decolonization of research paradigms, this article suggests that such paradigms must be developed, from scratch, conjointly between Indigenous and Western researchers.

### Introduction

- all R is informed by a paradigm which then informs methodology and methods
- paradigm also called `philosophical stance` or `conceptual framework`
> a set of metaphysical beliefs, assumptions, concepts, and values that informs the researcherâ€™s view of reality, what counts as knowledge and ways of knowing and guides research priorities, choices, and actions

- can be believed but not proven
- worldview of a paradigm is defined by assumptions regarding
  - ontology (nature of reality)
  - epistemology (nature of knowledge)
  - axiology (values)
  - methodology (purpose and process of R)
- these assumptions of a paradigm are internally coherent w/i the paradigm and distinguish each paradigm

- common paradigms in SSQ R; all from a western, euro-centric tradition
  - postpositivist
  - constructivist (interpretevist)
  - transformative
  - pragmatic
- academia tends to focus on western paradigms
- Indigenous methods may be *objects* of research, but not yet legitimate and coequal *approaches* to R
> This manifestation of ontological oppression is a result of Western science being exported around the globe from Europe alongside imperialistic and colonial attitudes

- in late 20th C, Indigenous scholars began to push back by articulating and reclaiming their methodologies and paradigms
- In Canada, this was pushed by the TRC, mandated by the *Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement*
> the TRC was a 5-year forward-looking quest to document the truth of Indian residential schools survivors, their families and communities in order to inform all Canadians about what happened in Indian residential schools and guide them in a process of reconciliation and renewed relationships that are based on mutual understanding and respect (Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, 2006, Schedule N).
