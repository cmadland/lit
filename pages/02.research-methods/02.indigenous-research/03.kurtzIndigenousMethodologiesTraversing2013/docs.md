### Abstract

Using Indigenous methodologies to guide a doctoral study honouring cultural traditions and protocols was integral in working with the local community. Traditional talking circles were used to create a culturally safe environment for urban Aboriginal women to talk about their health care experiences and recommend strategies for change. The methodological research process was guided and shaped by Elders and community members sharing their knowledge and stories. This fluid non-linearity and unpredictability, common in Indigenous methodologies, challenged the researcher to stay true to the methodology while simultaneously respecting cultural protocols and traditions. The successes and challenges of embracing Indigenous methodologies in the midst of academia without losing sight of respect, commitment and accountability to Indigenous peoples and the institution are offered.

### Keywords
Indigenous research, Indigenous methodology, Indigenous knowledge

> The methodology chosen was a living process, not a static framework, model, or flowchart of step- by- step lists of things to do along the way. All aspects of the study and methodology were developed, monitored, implemented, and evaluated by myself in collaboration with doctoral supervisors, community Elders (particularly one who is my mentor and was Elder Advisor for the study),
14 urban Aboriginal women who participated in the study, an advisory committee, and a steering group that oversaw the study. The advisory committee included members who were Aboriginal and experts in Indigenous research, education and culture, and the steering group consisted of some of the urban Aboriginal women who wanted to be more intimately involved in the research by taking on a leadership role.

### Finding a research methodology that honoured Indigenous and Western worldviews
- important for R to write about their position in the world at the outset of the work as "a promise that the research will not take place without the trust of the community"
  - personal historic details in respect of one's family and land and so that others can relate
  - act of asking for mutual trust based on relations and connections
- elders guided and mentored R in appropriate and culturally safe ways
- R rejected narrative inquiry, post-colonialism, post-structuralism, gender analysis, and white studies as they are all grounded in Western colonial research discourse
- Western research processes originate in oppressive systems and fail to recognize methodologies that decolonize
- Indigenous approach can draw on both interpretative and critical/emancipatory theories but does not fit into pre-existing Western paradigms

> Decolonizing methodologies “privilege Indigenous knowledge, voices, experiences, refl ections, and analyses of their social, material
and spiritual conditions” (Rigney, as cited in Smith, 2005, p. 87) and in doing so increase the presence, visibility and voice of Indigenous people (Brown & Strega, 2005; Kovach, 2005; Smith, 1999) and protect Indigenous knowledge.

### Understanding Indigenous knowledge in Indigenous research
- IR should be developed and led by Indigenous scholars alongside non-Indigenous researchers
- IR is a tool used for survival, healing, and self-determination ... Indigenous ppl must be the ones to plan, implement and evaluate solutions for Indigenous communities
- Indigenous knowledge spans culture, history, geography and is centred in the spiritual
  - includes intuitiveness about the connectedness of life and cosmos
  - multiple ways of knowing
  - language and place
  - values
  - holistic
  - metaphysical
  - emphasizes relationships between persons and these entities
- no single definition b/c it is a holistic perspective where arts, science, religion, and philosophy are not separate
- cumulative BoK handed down through generations

##### Three themes to inform R practice

- relational
  - all life forms
  - only what is needed is taken
  - what is not needed is given back with thanks
- collective
  - requires long-term, enduring relationships characterized by reciprocity and accountability
  - ensure process was directed by community members and co-researchers who were to benefit and be affected by research
  - avoid imposing Western concepts, so work with Elders and advisors
    - define RQs
    - determine whom to invite to participate
    - choose methodology
    - direct sharing of findings
    - work with non-Aboriginal advisory members and doc supervisors
  - community research agreement was signed by Elders and member of Aboriginal community
- methods
  - acknowledge alternative ways of knowing
    - insights from dreams and storytelling

### Indigenous methodologies, insights and guides
- decolonizing methodologies is critical and requires
- > long- term process involving the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic and psychological divesting of colonial power” (Smith, 1999, p. 98) in which First Nations people have the right to self- determination through principles of “ownership, control, access and possession” of research in order to transform change for and by Aboriginal people (Schnarch, 2004, p. 94).
- community requires OCAP of Indigenous knowledge
  - Ownership
  - Control
  - Access
  - Possession
- Women in this study struggled with the time it took to ensure confidentiality and proper ownership of knowledge before they shared

- in order for ownership to occur
  - R must be locally and ethically developed
  - culturally appropriate
  - critically evaluated
