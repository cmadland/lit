### Abstract

Based upon expansions of indigenous research methodologies in the literature, researchers are encouraged to understand indigenous research conceptualization and implementation within various communities. The purpose of this review is to outline six tenets or principles that are intended to engage researchers in practices that privilege the voices and goals of indigenous populations: indigenous identity development; indigenous paradigmatic lens; reflexivity and power sharing; critical immersion; participation and accountability; and methodological flexibility. Future research directions for expanding and operationalizing principles of indigenous research practices are also provided.

### Keywords
Indigenous research, qualitative research, guidelines, best practices

### Key quotes and ideas

> Research in social, economic, and natural sciences has been conventionally defined as discovering a generalizable truth based on systematic data interpretation while attending to reliability and validity concerns (Smith, 2012). Such research, employing scientific and positivistic methods frequently developed in lab settings, aims for replication of results via experimentation and often undervalues participant contributions to studies. These methodological “rules” guide how researchers proceed, often with detachment that further objectifies populations that have limited power. Results oftentimes privilege voices of those following conventional research practices with academic training in Eurocentric perspectives, likely excluding indigenous ways of knowing and equitable participation in research processes in general (Kovach, 2009; Smith, 2012).

> Thus, research may be synonymous with power and control: power over what ideas and findings matter and from whose perspective. Research is seldom the idea of those being researched, and rarely directly benefits them. As Cram, Ormond, and Carter (2006) noted, “researchers are knowledge brokers, people who have the power to construct legitimating arguments for or against ideas, theories or practices. They are collectors of information and producers of meaning which can be used for, or against indigenous interests” (p. 177).

### Qualitative R
> Although developments in qualitative research address some concerns of conventional research methods, there are still limitations to employing qualitative methodology with indigenous populations globally. Even discourse on broad historical moments in qualitative research (see Denzin & Lincoln, 2011) address the transitions needed in methodology, speaking to the needs of indigenous populations.

### Defining 'Indigenous'
- beyond identity being rooted in a particular geography
> *Indigenous populations* [as] individuals or groups belonging to developing or underdeveloped regions nationally or internationally, as well as those who have been marginalized by Eurocentric values and/or research methodologies

- Indigenous populations are affected by colonialism
- they experience subjugation resulting from current and historical oppression
- tend to distrust settler culture as they try to make meaning of themselves in the world

### conventional R
- objectifies Indigenous populations for the benefit of settler society
- furthers agendas unrelated to needs of Indigenous populations
- employs oppressive and extractive methods such as using traditional knowledge without permission or for profit
- Indigenous populations do not benefit

### Indigenous R
> indigenous research recognizes indigenous communities develop shared ways of knowing guided by how they view the world, themselves, and the connection between the two.

- combination of reflection of and resistance to colonization
- Rs reflect on who owns, designs, interprets, reports, and benefits from R
- R becomes a process of rewriting history

> As Smith (2012) notes,
>> History is also about power … it is the story of the powerful and how they became powerful, and then how they use their power to keep them in positions in which they can continue to dominate others. … in this sense history is not important for indigenous peoples because a thousand accounts of the “truth” will not alter the “fact” that indigenous peoples are still marginal and do not possess the power to transform history into justice. (p. 35)

- IR is value-based
- process of coming together to contribute to the welfare of the community
- axiological assumptions embedded (4Rs) `see Tessaro et al, 2018`
  - responsibility
  - respect
  - reciprocity
  - rights and regulations

> The core of indigenous research, then, is attention to ethics and reflexivity regarding access to and privileging of knowledge, selection of methodological tools, and presentation of perspectives possessing physical, psychological, and sociopolitical consequences.

- goal is self-determination with protection of Indigenous knowledge
- agenda involves attending to healing, mobilization, transformation, and decolonization

> Part of the conventional research struggle—whether quantitative or qualitative—is movement beyond “telling pain stories” (Tuck & Yang, 2014), which serves intentionally or unintentionally to further pathologize or disempower communities, towards humanizing common struggles while privileging communities’ conceptualization, ownership, and knowledge. Thus, there is a need for more specific practices researchers can use to unpack what indigenous research is, can, and should be.

### Development of Guiding Principles
- instructor + 3 doc students, 3-credit course
- foundational knowledge of qual RM
- engaged in activities to decolonize conventional R
- developed a list of 10 recommendations, refined to 6
- course did not include collaboration w/ Indigenous people(!)

### Indigenous Identity Development

> involves active renegotiation of one’s cultural identity to accommodate understanding how colonization has influenced personal identity of self and others.

- all individuals can move towards greater understanding of Indigenous identity

> Privileging indigenous identity can allow for attending to how colonization has influenced individual and community ways of knowing and what gets prioritized as knowledge (Kovach, 2009; Smith, 2012).

##### 5 sequential phases
1. rediscovery and discovery, or re-learning of one’s history to understand culture, language and identity in new ways;
2. mourning or lamenting one’s victimization by colonizers as one continues building new identity;
3. dreaming — which is rethinking institutions and structures developed and maintained by colonizers in ways that self-empowers;
4. commitment, or the active endorsement of identity meaningful to indigenous communities; and
5. action, which is reconstruction and implementation of decolonized identity once commitment is achieved.

- Non-Indigenous researchers follow parallel path:
  - understanding role colonization has played in our privilege and perpetuating oppression
  - processing emotions related to growing awareness
  - correct inaccurate or misapplied knowledge systems and accommodate multiple ways of knowing

! > For researchers belonging to indigenous groups, decolonization phases must occur within personal and professional realms: decolonization of self and the research community. For non-indigenous researchers, valuing indigenous identity equates to advocating for new, affirmative research paradigms and methodologies for indigenous groups. **While non-indigenous researchers cannot identify as indigenous, they can move towards greater empathy for historical and current struggles associated with colonization and create change in the research process, which also allows space for indigenous researchers to employ and/or develop indigenous methodologies.**

> When asserting indigenous knowledge systems are not to be viewed from confines of Eurocentric knowledge systems, Ray (2012), a member of the Anishnaabe indigenous group, included a personal story about indigenous methodologies; sharing of personal stories is part of this indigenous researcher’s commitment to Anishnaabe storytelling traditions and emphasizes the process is as important as the product.

### Indigenous Paradigmatic Lens
> using research approaches congruent with indigenous values and research goals, thus researchers must articulate a paradigmatic lens consonant with privileging the knowledge and voices of indigenous populations
