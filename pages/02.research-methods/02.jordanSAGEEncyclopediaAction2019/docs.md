- NOT a methodology for studying specific Indigenous populations

> a heterogeneous set of methodologies and methods in the service of indigenous peoples aimed at comprehending, explicating and analyzing the contemporary world from their standpoint within it

- allows Indigenous worldviews, epistemologies to define how research should be conducted according to protocols established by Indigenous communities

> IRM is probably best conceptualized as a continuum that encapsulates a wide range of research methodologies and methods that are concerned with indigenous epistemologies, ontology, voice and identity.

#### History, Themes and Issues

1. IRM is closely aligned with social and political movements focusing on decolonizing institutions imposed by colonial powers (residential schools), and resisting commodification of traditional Indigenous lands (mining, forestry).
2.  efforts aimed at self-determination, ranging from asserting individual and collective rights and self-governance to creating public spaces in mainstream society for indigenous issues, concerns and rights to be addressed (e.g. Truth and Reconciliation Commissions).
3. recognition that indigenous knowledge, customs, spirituality, traditional medicine and healing practices are deep reservoirs for constructing indigenous research methodologies that are autonomous of, and distinct from, existing Western research traditions.

Despite establishment of Indigenous Education programs, traditional disciplines (humanities, STEM, medicine) have done little to acknowledge indigenous worldviews; Indigenous ppl are still *objects* of research.
- notable examples are education and social work
- Association of Canadian Deans of Education Accord on Indigenous Education
  - to actively foster a socially just society for indigenous peoples;
  - to acknowledge a respectful, collaborative and consultative process between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples;
  - to promote partnerships between educational institutions and indigenous communities and
  - to value the diversity of indigenous knowledges and learning.

#### Principles and Practices

> The overarching consideration against which all IRM has to be contextualized is the history of colonization that most indigenous people have been subjected to over the past 500-plus years in North America and around the rest of the globe.
- IRM is not just another tool in the box
