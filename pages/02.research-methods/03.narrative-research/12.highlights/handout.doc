<p>Is the use of lived and told stories to understand experiences. It is a collaborative process between the researcher and participants. It occurs over a long period of time in one or many places as a result of social interactions in social environments (Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2017, p. 425)</p>

<h5 id="living-stories"><em>Living</em> stories</h5>
<p>Put simply, people live their own stories. Each person’s present story is influenced by their past experiences, contexts, cultures, families, beliefs, and myriad other influences, so each person’s story is utterly unique. Each person in the group juggling activity had a different experience of the activity because of their past experiences.</p>
<h5 id="telling-stories"><em>Telling</em> stories</h5>
<p>As people live, they also tell their stories to others.</p>
<h5 id="retelling-stories"><em>Retelling</em> stories</h5>
<p>As researchers come alongside people and inquire into their stories, the peoples’ stories are retold, but this time with the addition of the researcher’s stories.</p>
<h5 id="reliving-stories"><em>Reliving</em> stories</h5>
<p>As researchers and participants are both changed in the retelling of their stories, both may begin to relive their stories.</p>
