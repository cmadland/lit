#### Starting Points
1. listening to stories
2. co-living stories

Narrative inquirers are always in relationship with the participants, and, contrary to other qualitative methods, do not bracket themselves, but rather, live in the midst of the participants and bring their own stories to bear.

#### Research Puzzles

- less precise than a research question
- less expectation of an answer
- re-search; continual reformulation as new stories are told
