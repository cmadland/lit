# Network Thinking
## Information Flows Like Water

> Indigenous revival cannot be understood without reference to the technology, power, and legitimacy of states. ~Ronald Niezen *The Origins of Indigenism*

> Understanding the concepts of technology, Indigeneity, and networks requires an understanding of the functions that communications technology and Native (sic) peoples ... completed in the formation of the modern technically advanced nation-state. (p. 9)

Duarte traces the history of mobile phones beyond wireless telegraphy to the expansion of the railroad, conquests against Indigenous people in Canada and the US as well as the beginnings of the concept of `manifest destiny`.
