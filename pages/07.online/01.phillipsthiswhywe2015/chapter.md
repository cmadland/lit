!!! Phillips, W. (2015). *This is why we canâ€™t have nice things: mapping the relationship between online trolling and mainstream culture.* Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.

#### Chapter 3

> Just as certain cities are said to be supporting characters in television shows, novels, and films for which they serve as backdrop ... online platforms impart a similar flavor. Indeed, far from being empty, value-neutral spaces, platforms have a profound effect on how communities form and what community members are able to accomplish while online. Given this complicated interplay, I was forced to adapt my research methods not just to the particular group I was studying, and not just the particular platform the frequented, but to the evolving interaction(s) between community, platform, and behavior. (p. 39)

### Part II

> ...it is simply not possible, or even advisable, to provide an overarching, universal answer to any question that attempts to sort trolls into *either* this *or* that.
A better and more fruitful question is the question I posed at the outset of this study. Specifically, how do trolls fit into mainstream culture? ... the answer to this question is "quite well." Not only to trolls scavenge, repurpose, and weaponize myriad aspects of mainstream culture (all the better to troll you with), mainstream culture normalizes and at times actively celebrates precisely those attitudes and behaviours that in trolling contxts are said to be aberrant, antisocial, and cruel.
It is at this point that trolls and trickster are most closely aligned. Much like mythological trickster figures, whose refusal to editorialize compels onlookers to make sense of what has happened, trolls' actions highlight the more ambivalent aspects of the dominant culture. Participating trolls might not be consciously aware of the ways in which their actions replicate mainstream tropes and behaviours, but they don't need to be. The important thing ... is that trolls *reveal*. (p. 49-50)

#### Chapter 4

> ... the interplay between mainstream media outlets and the trolls who troll them highlights the striking overlap between trolls and their most vociferous opponents. ... trolls and sensationalist media outlets are in fact locked in a cybernetic feedback loop predicated on spectacle; each camp amplifies and builds upon the other's reactions, resulting in a relationship that can only be described as symbiotic. (p. 52)
