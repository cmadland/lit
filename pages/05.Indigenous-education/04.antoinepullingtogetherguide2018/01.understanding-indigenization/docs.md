[Activity 1](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/chapter-1/)

!!!! How does your personal and academic background and identity impact your knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples?

My knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples is limited by my personal and academic background. My high school and first undergrad degree were *very* white and homogeneous, at private religious schools. Following that, my second undergrad and first grad degree were both at much more diverse schools with more intentionality about indigenization, but still relatively little compared to most schools today.

!!!! What is your current relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I am a descendent of European settlers and live, work, and learn on unceded Indigenous land.

!!!! What changes do you want to make in my relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I feel compelled to work towards reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and to use my privilege to empower the Indigenous People around me.

!!!! As a curriculum developer, how do you view your role in Indigenization?

See my previous answer.

### Indigenization, Decolonization, and Reconciliation [Link](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/indigenization-decolonization-and-reconciliation/)

##### Indigenization
> a process of naturalizing Indigenous knowledge systems and making them evident to transform spaces, places, and hearts. In the context of post-secondary education, this involves bringing Indigenous knowledge and approaches together with Western knowledge systems. This benefits not only Indigenous students but all students, teachers, and community members involved or impacted by Indigenization. [LINK](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/indigenization-decolonization-and-reconciliation/)

- not replacing 'Western' with 'Indigenous', but 'remix', or "weaving or braiding" to encourage appreciation of both
- not an 'add-on'
- deliberate blending of two knowledge systems

##### Decolonization
> Decolonization refers to the process of deconstructing colonial ideologies of the superiority and privilege of Western thought and approaches.

- dismantling status quo
- "valuing and revitalizing Indigenous knowledge"
- new ways of thinking, worldview perspective
- critical examination of western epistemology
- changing misconceptions
- for settlers, "decolonization is the process of examining your beliefs about Indigenous Peoples and culture by learning about yourself in relationship to the communities where you live and the people with whom you interact."
- must be led by Indigenous people

##### Reconciliation
> Reconciliation is about addressing past wrongs done to Indigenous Peoples, making amends, and improving relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to create a better future for all. Chief Justice Murray Sinclair, chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, has stated,

! “Reconcilliation is not an Aboriginal problem – it involves all of us”

- restoring damaged relationships
  - apologizing
  - building trust
  - recognizing mutual humanity
  - concrete actions
- not only between individuals, but groups and over hundreds of years

! "Clearly, the onus for this action is on the party that perpetrated the harm, which in this case is settler society."

### The need to Indigenize [Link](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/the-need-to-indigenize/)

##### Exclusion and misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples

- academic curricula have privileged Western thought, content, approaches and values
- Indigenous worldview have been excluded and misrepresented
- exclusion and misrepresentation is extremely damaging and a powerful tool for assimilation

##### Indigenization is not multiculturalism

- not an abandonment of MC
- MC does not address social injustices and racist policies. Indigenous experiences and immigrant/minority settler expereinces are vastly different
- we live on unceded land; we are visitors

> Jim Silver (2006) illustrates this point: “Canada takes pride for example, in being the destination for many runaway African-American slaves who were fleeing their captors by taking the ‘underground railway’ in search of freedom. Yet Canada’s police force relentlessly hunted down Aboriginal children who had escaped captivity in a residential school” (p. 24).

##### Benefits of indigenization
- not just an 'Indigenous issue'; all benefit
- creates a more just world
- shared understanding promotes reconciliation
- complementary knowledge systems, not opposing binary
  - different systems fill in gaps for each other

###### Two-eyed seeing/*Etuaptmumk* [Marshall, 2017 (PDF)](http://www.integrativescience.ca/uploads/files/Two-Eyed%20Seeing-AMarshall-Thinkers%20Lodge2017(1).pdf)
> the realization that beneficial outcomes are much more likely in any given situation if we are willing to bring two or more perspectives into play

- gift of multiple perspectives

> learn to see from your one eye with the best or the strengths in the Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing ... and learn to see from your other eye with the best or the strengths in the mainstream (Western or Eurocentric) knowledges and ways of knowing ... but most importantly, learn to see with both these eyes together, for the benefit of all

- co-learning is essential in the process
- "weaving back and forth between knowledges"

> Elder Albert recommends the approach be pictured in the following way: “Sometimes it’s like a heavy sledge that we are trying to move – this sledge represents our passions for ensuring the ecological integrity of Mawisikamukawey (the nurturing wholeness of the earth), the well-being of our communities, and the transmission of our Mi’kmaq culture (and/or other Indigenous cultures) and knowledge(s). We, the Elders, are dragging that sledge with all our might, and we need others to help us by pushing as hard as you can on the rear of the sledge. But, it is we, the Elders, who will determine where it goes. Other times that heavy sledge represents a passion we Elders hold that the Western sciences can help address. Then we, the Elders, will help you Western scientists with that sledge ... you drag, we push ... while we all also constantly exchange understandings about where it is going ... and learn to abide by i’l’oqaptmu’k meaning “to revisit to renew, to maintain movement in the direction Spirit intended”. Indeed, Elder Albert says, the capacity to abide by i’l’oqaptmu’k is the essence of co-learning and essential to Two-Eyed Seeing. Other essentials are knowledge scrutinization or inquiry (to learn to be able to see in genuine and meaningful ways the best, the strengths, within our different knowledges); knowledge validation (by peers, to ensure authenticity, accuracy, and sacredness), and knowledge gardening (to learn to walk our talk, together, within grounded projects that have meaningful community relevance).

- not picking bits and pieces of Indigenous knowledge to include in western conceptions to make it more palatable
