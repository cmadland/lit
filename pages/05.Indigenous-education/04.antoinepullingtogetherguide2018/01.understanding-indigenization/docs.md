[Activity 1](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/chapter-1/)

!!!! How does your personal and academic background and identity impact your knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples?

My knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples is limited by my personal and academic background. My high school and first undergrad degree were *very* white and homogeneous, at private religious schools. Following that, my second undergrad and first grad degree were both at much more diverse schools with more intentionality about indigenization, but still relatively little compared to most schools today.

!!!! What is your current relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I am a descendent of European settlers and live, work, and learn on unceded Indigenous land.

!!!! What changes do you want to make in my relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I feel compelled to work towards reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and to use my privilege to empower the Indigenous People around me.

!!!! As a curriculum developer, how do you view your role in Indigenization?

See my previous answer.

### Indigenization, Decolonization, and Reconciliation [Link](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/indigenization-decolonization-and-reconciliation/)

##### Indigenization
> a process of naturalizing Indigenous knowledge systems and making them evident to transform spaces, places, and hearts. In the context of post-secondary education, this involves bringing Indigenous knowledge and approaches together with Western knowledge systems. This benefits not only Indigenous students but all students, teachers, and community members involved or impacted by Indigenization. [LINK](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/indigenization-decolonization-and-reconciliation/)

- not replacing 'Western' with 'Indigenous', but 'remix', or "weaving or braiding" to encourage appreciation of both
- not an 'add-on'
- deliberate blending of two knowledge systems

##### Decolonization
> Decolonization refers to the process of deconstructing colonial ideologies of the superiority and privilege of Western thought and approaches.

- dismantling status quo
- "valuing and revitalizing Indigenous knowledge"
- new ways of thinking, worldview perspective
- critical examination of western epistemology
- changing misconceptions
- for settlers, "decolonization is the process of examining your beliefs about Indigenous Peoples and culture by learning about yourself in relationship to the communities where you live and the people with whom you interact."
- must be led by Indigenous people

##### Reconciliation
> Reconciliation is about addressing past wrongs done to Indigenous Peoples, making amends, and improving relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to create a better future for all. Chief Justice Murray Sinclair, chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, has stated,

! “Reconcilliation is not an Aboriginal problem – it involves all of us”

- restoring damaged relationships
  - apologizing
  - building trust
  - recognizing mutual humanity
  - concrete actions
- not only between individuals, but groups and over hundreds of years

! "Clearly, the onus for this action is on the party that perpetrated the harm, which in this case is settler society."

### The need to Indigenize [Link](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/the-need-to-indigenize/)

##### Exclusion and misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples

- academic curricula have privileged Western thought, content, approaches and values
- Indigenous worldview have been excluded and misrepresented
- exclusion and misrepresentation is extremely damaging and a powerful tool for assimilation

##### Indigenization is not multiculturalism

- not an abandonment of MC
- MC does not address social injustices and racist policies. Indigenous experiences and immigrant/minority settler expereinces are vastly different
- we live on unceded land; we are visitors

> Jim Silver (2006) illustrates this point: “Canada takes pride for example, in being the destination for many runaway African-American slaves who were fleeing their captors by taking the ‘underground railway’ in search of freedom. Yet Canada’s police force relentlessly hunted down Aboriginal children who had escaped captivity in a residential school” (p. 24).

##### Benefits of indigenization
- not just an 'Indigenous issue'; all benefit
- creates a more just world
- shared understanding promotes reconciliation
- complementary knowledge systems, not opposing binary
  - different systems fill in gaps for each other

> the realization that beneficial outcomes are much more likely in any given situation if we are willing to bring two or more perspectives into play
