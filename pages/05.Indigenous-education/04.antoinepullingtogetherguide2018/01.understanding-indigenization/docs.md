[Activity 1](https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationcurriculumdevelopers/chapter/chapter-1/)

!!!! How does your personal and academic background and identity impact your knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples?

My knowledge and experience of Indigenous Peoples is limited by my personal and academic background. My high school and first undergrad degree were *very* white and homogeneous, at private religious schools. Following that, my second undergrad and first grad degree were both at much more diverse schools with more intentionality about indigenization, but still relatively little compared to most schools today.

!!!! What is your current relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I am a descendent of European settlers and live, work, and learn on unceded Indigenous land.

!!!! What changes do you want to make in my relationship to Indigenous Peoples?

I feel compelled to work towards reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and to use my privilege to empower the Indigenous People around me.

!!!! As a curriculum developer, how do you view your role in Indigenization?
