### Abstract

All research is guided by a set of philosophical underpinnings. Indigenous methodologies are in line with an Indigenous paradigm, while critical and liberatory methodologies fit with the transformative paradigm. Yet Indigenous and transformative methodologies share an emancipatory and critical stance and thus are increasingly used in tandem by both Western and Indigenous scholars in an attempt to decolonize methodologies, research, and the academy as a whole. However, these multiparadigmatic spaces only superficially support decolonization which, in the Canadian context of settler colonialism, is a radical and unsettling prospect that is about land, resources, and sovereignty. Applying this definition of decolonization to the decolonization of research paradigms, this article suggests that such paradigms must be developed, from scratch, conjointly between Indigenous and Western researchers.

### Introduction

- all R is informed by a paradigm which then informs methodology and methods
- paradigm also called `philosophical stance` or `conceptual framework`
> a set of metaphysical beliefs, assumptions, concepts, and values that informs the researcher’s view of reality, what counts as knowledge and ways of knowing and guides research priorities, choices, and actions

- can be believed but not proven
- worldview of a paradigm is defined by assumptions regarding
  - ontology (nature of reality)
  - epistemology (nature of knowledge)
  - axiology (values)
  - methodology (purpose and process of R)
- these assumptions of a paradigm are internally coherent w/i the paradigm and distinguish each paradigm

- common paradigms in SSQ R; all from a western, euro-centric tradition
  - postpositivist
  - constructivist (interpretevist)
  - transformative
  - pragmatic
- academia tends to focus on western paradigms
- Indigenous methods may be *objects* of research, but not yet legitimate and coequal *approaches* to R
> This manifestation of ontological oppression is a result of Western science being exported around the globe from Europe alongside imperialistic and colonial attitudes

- in late 20th C, Indigenous scholars began to push back by articulating and reclaiming their methodologies and paradigms
- In Canada, this was pushed by the TRC, mandated by the *Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement*
> the TRC was a 5-year forward-looking quest to document the truth of Indian residential schools survivors, their families and communities in order to inform all Canadians about what happened in Indian residential schools and guide them in a process of reconciliation and renewed relationships that are based on mutual understanding and respect (Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, 2006, Schedule N).

- TRC calls on Canada to adopt and implement the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)*
  - UNDRIP took 25 years to negotiate

> to enshrine the rights that “constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the Indigenous peoples of the world” (Art. 43), including their rights to enjoy and practice their culture and customs, their religions and languages and to develop and strengthen their economies and their social and political institutions (UNDRIP, 2007).

- when UNDRIP was adopted by UN, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and US voted against it
- Canada finally signed in 2016

> To decolonize research paradigms and methodologies is to include Indigenous ways of knowing in academia, that is, to teach them, to use them in research, to value them as equal to Western approaches to knowing and to creating knowledge.

- many Rs experiment with combining Indigenous and Western methodologies
- few hint at issues of blending two methodologies from different paradigms
  - likely because discussions are relatively new

- Two streams of thinking
  - it is worth bringing transformative and Indigenous paradigms into conversation as they share some assumptions
  - Indigenous paradigms are so distinct from Western approaches that they cannot be considered a sub-paradigm in the current typology and need their own category
- Indigenous scholars strain at having to force their approaches into western categories
- Indigenous pathways fo research are not readily available to non-Indigenous R

!! This article discusses the need for a third route where a new multiparadigmatic space is coproduced by Western and Indigenous scholars with the aspiration of true and full decolonization, understood as a mutual endeavor with an unpredictable outcome.

### Positionality
- doing research at the intersection of western and Indigenous ways of knowing can become an expression of colonialism
- pitfalls
  - focusing on the differences between western and Indigenous WoK
  - evading epistemic racism
  - using Indigenous knowledge solely to corroborate and complement western knowledge

### Philosophical Orientations of Social Inquiry

##### Western Research Paradigms

- Positivism (empiricism)
  - borrowed from natural sciences
- postpositivism
  - evolved from positivism
- constructivist
  - emerged to describe and understand human experience
- transformative
  - unites different frameworks to engage with issues of power and justice
- pragmatic
  - mixes qualitative and quantitative

##### Table 1. Philosophical assumptions of the major paradigms that may inform social inquiry

|   | Positivist (Empiricist)| Postpositivist (Critical Realist)| Constructivist (Interpretivist) | Transformative (frm. Critical Theory)| Pragmatic| Indigenous|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Ontology   | Realist; one knowable reality  | Critical Realist; one reality, probabilistically knowable   |Relativist; multiple, socially constructed realities   | Historical/social realism; multiple, socially and historically shaped realities  | Realist; unique individual interpretations of one reality  |Relativist, relational; multiple, socially constructed realities, mutual reality based on multitude of relationships   |
|Epistemology   |Objectivist, empirical; research findings are true   |Objectivist, empirical; research findings are probably true  |Subjectivist, experiential; findings are created; idiographic, contextual   |Intersubjective, experiential; value-mediated findings, knowledge is socially and historically situated; dialectical understanding   | Dependent on particular study   |Intersubjective; experiential, knowledge is relational   |
|Axiology   |Values excluded; influence denied   | Values excluded; influence denied  | Values included; formative  | Values included; formative research a means for social emancipation; solidarity with the oppressed  |Dependent on context/particular study   |Values included; formative research guided by relational accountability that promotes respectful representation and reciprocity   |
|Methodology   |Experimental/manipulative; correlational; quantitative verification of hypotheses; decontextualized   |Modified experimental/manipulative; falsification of hypotheses, decontextualized   | Hermeneutical/dialectical; qualitative, contextualized  |Dialogic/dialectical; qualitative or mixed methods; informed by theories (feminist theories, postcolonial discourse), political; contextual, participatory    |Approaches matched to questions and purposes of research; predominantly mixed methods   |Participatory, lliberatory, transformative; positioned in Indigenous knowledge systems   |

> The positivist and postpositivist paradigms with their realist ontology and an axiology that positions research as value free are ill-suited for research at the interface of Western and Indigenous ways of knowing.

> While the transformative paradigm is still a Western approach, it is value driven due to its interest in power relations and thus has the potential to be more inclusive of other, including non-Western, epistemologies, and ontologies (Cram & Mertens, 2015, 2016).

- pragmatic paradigm may be employed in MM research to merge conflicting qual and quan methods
- focus on common sense and less metaphysical
  - intersubjectivity of the social life
  - allows researcher to study whatever is of interest
  - limited to gain knowledge to pursue desired ends
  - freedom to choose and combine methods as appropriate to the question

##### Indigenous frameworks

- Indigenous peoples distrust 'research' and have become among the most researched people groups
  - natural scientists examined Indigenous territory in order to exploit resources for profit
  - white settler social scientists studied Indigenous peoples in order to solve 'Indigenous problems'  and inform policy
  - research was carried out by non-Indigenous people using a colonial worldview
  - R was exploitative and Indigenous communities were not beneficiaries, or even equal participants
  - not only aimed at assimilating Indigenous ppl, but also invasive and unethical (skin grafting experiments on Inuit ppl w/o consent)
- early Indigenous paradigms developed by Māori in NZ and also Indigenist paradigm in Australia.
- North American Indigenous groups followed as well as African, Latin American, and Pacific Islanders

> By developing and expressing Indigenous research paradigms and methodologies, Indigenous scholars from around the world are reclaiming research, and with it knowledge, language, and culture, for their peoples. Regaining control over research by reframing it under their worldviews is an act of resistance to racist and colonial oppression (Martin, 2002, as cited in Rigney, 1999; Steinhauer, 2002).

- Common reason for using Indigenous approaches is to decolonize western approaches
- commonality among Indigenous approaches
  - ontologies, epistemologies, axiologies, and methodologies are all rooted in the land, and in the local.
  - methodologies and epistemologies are forms of critical pedagogy in that “they embody a critical politics of representation that is embedded in the rituals of indigenous communities” (Denzin & Lincoln, 2008a, p. 3)
  - surprisingly similar across the world in terms of understanding of interconnectedness and interdependence
  - long-term perspectives
  - adaptaion to change
  - commitment to the commons
- some  have proposed pan-indigenous paradigms, others say such are too general to be useful

> - metaphysical assumptions of Indigenous research paradigms
>   - a relativist (there are multiple, socially and historically shaped realities) and relational ontology (mutual reality based on multitude of relationships)
>   - an intersubjective and relational epistemology in which knowledge is relational, that is, based on a multitude of relationships (in Indigenous philosophy, there is no clear distinction between ontology and epistemology due to their relationality)
>   - an axiology that promotes respectful representation and reciprocity through relational accountability; and
>   - a participatory, liberatory methodology that is relational and transformative (Chilisa, 2012; Wilson, 2008)

- relationality is central, as is knowledge as a collective, including the spiritual world and entire cosmos
