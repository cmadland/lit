*So, study your chosen papers for examples of Kemmis et al's Ten Key Features of Public Spheres. For example, how are public spheres in Kaukko's research self-constituted, voluntary and autonomous? What more or less should be considered with respect to participation for action?

Try to find examples of each of the 10 key features in your chosen papers. Some features will be more apparent than others.

In your blog post discuss any 2 features found or not in your chosen papers (see below)*

## Abstract
A conception of action research is offered that is collaborative, participatory, targets ethical issues and includes students. Collaboration is ‘organic’ in that all members share the goal of the research and are interdependent in pursuing that goal. Participation is authentic, requiring a continuing negotiation of planning, roles, power differences and language. An ecological approach to ethics is examined in which the research community is regarded as an interconnected, interdependent, holistic system of language, relationships and ideas. A rationale for the authentic participation of students in research is offered based on ethical requirements, improved research benefits and professional enhancement.

### Thoughts

On p 348, Collins quotes Fritjov Capra (1983)

> To avoid confusion we may reserve the term ‘hierarchy’ for those rigid systems of domination and control in which orders are transmitted from the top down. The traditional symbol for these structures has been the pyramid ... That is why I have turned the pyramid around and transformed it into a tree, a more appropriate symbol for the ecological nature of stratification in living systems. `As a real tree takes its nourishment through both its roots and its leaves, so the power in a systems tree flows in both directions, with neither end dominating the other and all levels interacting in the interdependent harmony to support the functioning of the whole.` (Capra, 1983, p. 282, emphasis added)

!!!  Capra, F. (1983) *The Turning Point: science, society and the rising culture.* New York: Bantam.

I appreciate this way of conceptualizing interdependence counter to the view that stratified human systems are hierarchical and driven by top-down power-laden structures.

> In organic, adaptive systems, connections, links, or relationships among parts are the focus, rather than the parts alone. in a classroom that promotes authentic participation, interactions among students and relationships throughout a stratified school structure are important...For the purposes of the following discussion, the classroom and those immersed in classroom research, are considered to be a dynamic, adaptive, ‘living’ system in which ecological considerations are paramount. (p. 348)

Collins rejects the use of utilitarian ethics which are common to IRBs in university.

> Each member, whether a teacher, student or researcher, is an integral part of a co-evolving whole. As such, it is not enough to make discrete judgments of the morality of specific actions or decisions. Rather, there is an ongoing process of negotiating power structures to maximise the inclusion of all. An ecological approach to ethics fits well with the collaborative action research methodology to be described here. It is compatible with the participatory aspect of the research and setting, and the focus on ongoing interactions within the community. (p. 349)

- AR does not allow for predictability, so consent is problematic
- also can't guaranteed avoidance of harm due to subtle events causing stress
- confidentiality also difficult due to the nature of qual research relying on rich descriptions

> Beyond just informed consent at the start of the research, cultural sensitivity must be an ongoing focus of reflection and discourse. More than avoidance of harm, ecological ethics demand that we recognise the individual as part of a larger system. Therefore, protection of the entire environment is necessary, including the attachment of every individual to the whole culture. To damage one part of an ecological system is to damage the whole and vice versa. Responsive communication in reporting, as contrasted to confidentiality, is necessary in ecological ethics. (p. 350)
