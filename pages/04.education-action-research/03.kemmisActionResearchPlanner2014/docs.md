After you complete the Task for this week (see Modules Class 4) post a brief response that articulates your growing/changing  understanding of action research in education (or some aspect of it) in the context of your own research area.

> Lewin (1951) likened action research to the work of bomber squadrons in the War: first, there would be a reconnaissance phase in which participants went out to collect initial data, then there would be the formation of a plan, which was then put into action, then more data would be collected to see the effects of the action, and this data would be analysed to see whether the desired effects had been achieved. If not, a new plan would be formulated and enacted, and further data gathered and analysed. The process would be repeated until the desired effects were achieved. (p. 8-9)

> Among the approaches to action research summarised below, participatory research and critical participatory action research share the central aspiration that the research should be the responsibility of participants alone, though participants also remain open to receiving assistance from outsiders where it is useful. A key question here is whether and the extent to which the self-interests of such outsiders coincide or conflict with the self-interests of the other participants. In our view, this is a question to be asked by and of all outside researchers and consultants working with participant researchers. (p. 9-10)

### Industrial action research
- consultant-driven
- workplace democratization

### Action Science
- distincitons btwn 'espoused theories' and 'theories in use'
- development of reflective practitioners

### Action Learning
- bringing people together to learn from each others' experience

### Soft Systems Approaches
- participants model Systems
- question the models
- reimagine possibilities

### Participatory Research
- roots in liberation theology
- shared ownership of R projects
- community-based analysis of social problems
- oriented towards community action

### Classroom action research
- qualitative modes of inquiry by teachers
- emphasis on teachers' self-understandings and judgments

### Critical participatory action research
> emerges from dissatisfactions with classroom action research which does typically not take a broad view of the role of the relationship between education and social change. (p. 12)

> Current thinking for critical participatory action research focuses on how to create (or recreate) new possibilities for what Orlando Fals Borda calls vivéncia (humane forms of social life) through the revitalization of the public sphere, and to promote decolonization of lifeworlds that have become saturated with bureaucratic discourses, routinised practices and institutionalised forms of social relationships, the characteristic of social systems that see the world only through the prism of organisation, not the human and humane living of social lives. (p. 12)

> In reality, action research is rarely as neat as this spiral of self-contained cycles of planning, acting and observing, and reflecting suggests. The stages overlap, and initial plans quickly become obsolete in the light of learning from experience. In reality, the process is likely to be more fluid, open and responsive. For critical participatory action research, the criterion of success is not whether participants have followed the steps faithfully, but whether they have a strong and authentic sense of development and evolution in their practices, their understandings of their practices, and the situations in which they practice. (p. 18-19)

> It should also be stressed that critical participatory action research involves the investigation of actual practices, not practices in the abstract. It involves learning about the real, material, concrete, particular practices of particular people in particular places. (p. 20)

> critical participatory action research has the goal of helping participants to work together towards making their individual and collective practices meet the criteria of rationality, sustainability and justice—working together to make their practices
- more rational in the senses of being more reasonable, more comprehensible, more coherent, and more sensible;
- more sustainable (including for the long term and for future generations) in the sense that they are more productive, more satisfying, and less wasteful; and
- more just in the sense that they more inclusive, more solidary (fostering solidarity), that they avoid the injustices of domination and oppression (Young 1990), and they do not cause harm to or suffering among particular individuals or
groups. (p. 22)

## 10 Features of Public Spheres
pp. 37-49

1. Public spheres are constituted as actual networks of communication among actual
participants.
2. Public Spheres are self-constituted, voluntary and autonomous.
   - outside formal systems of administration or influence
   - focused on a particular theme or concern
   - voluntarism can be an institutional demand
3. Public spheres come into existence in response to legitimation deficits.
   - people think things aren't quite right (Precious knowledge: Ss and Ts saw that plans to cancel the Raza program was oppressive)
   - participants do not feel that they would necessarily have come to the decision to do things the ways they now do them, especially if they feel this way about how they are now required to do them.
4. Public spheres are constituted for communicative action and for public discourse.
