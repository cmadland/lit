!!! Freire, P. (2018). *Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 50th Anniversary Edition.* Bloomsbury Academic.

> But the humanist, revolutionary educator cannot wait for this possibility to materialize (the realization that the banking model of education is irreconcilable with their vocation to become more fully human). From the outset, her efforts must coincide with those of the students to engage in critical thinking and the quest for mutual humanization. His efforts must be imbued with a profound trust in people and their creative power. To achieve this, they must be partners of the students in their relations with them. (p. 75)

The banking model of education, with students as objects of the teacher's knowledge-pushing activities, is often depicted in modern parlance as the 'sage on the stage' model. The lecture is an easy target to skewer because it seems to epitomize the banking model.

In response, some educators who presume themselves to be progressing beyond the 'sage on the stage' model have adopted the 'guide on the side' model, which has always been a stone in my shoe that I couldn't quite find to remove. The quote above from Freire nails the problem.

Sages on stages and guides on sides *are the same*. They both rely on the banking model. They both presume that the teacher is the expert who is tasked with 'educating' the student, the ignorant novice who doesn't recognize their humanity in Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic.

Only when teachers and students are trusting/trusted partners in humanizing each other have they moved beyond the banking model.
