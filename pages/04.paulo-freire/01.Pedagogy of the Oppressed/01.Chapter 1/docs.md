!!! Freire, P. (2018). *Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 50th Anniversary Edition.* Bloomsbury Academic.


> Dehumanization, which marks not only those whose humanity has been stolen, but also (though in a different way) those who have stolen it, is a *distortion* of becoming more fully human. (p. 44)

This idea that dehumanization distorts both the oppressed and the oppressor is a critical idea to understanding situations where oppression has occurred. In Canada, this can be seen in both the violence committed against Indigenous people, as well as (at various times), against Chinese, Japanese, Africans, women, and countless other marginalized groups, and also in the dehumanization of the white settlers, the various levels of government and religious institutions.

> Because it is a distortion of being more fully human, sooner or later being less human leads the oppressed to struggle against those who made them so. In order for this struggle to have meaning, the oppressed must not, in seeking to regain their humanity (which is a way to create it), become in turn oppressors of the oppressors, but rather restorers of the humanity of both. (p. 44)

Freire returns to this idea over and over again in the chapter. It seems almost inevitable that in seeking to overthrow oppressive regimes or people, the only replacement is oppression in a different form or person.

> This then is the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed: to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well. (p. 44)

> only  power that springs from the weakness of the oppressed will be sufficiently strong to free both. Any attempt to "soften" the power of the oppressor in deference to the weakness of the oppressed almost always manifests itself in the form of false generosity; indeed, the attempt never goes beyond this. (p. 44)
