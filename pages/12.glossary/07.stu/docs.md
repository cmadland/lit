### Tribal sovereignty

> At its most minimal, tribal sovereignty may be understood as the dynamic relationship between the will of a people to live by the ways of knowing they have cultivated over millenia within a homeland and the legal and political rights they have negotiated with the occupying federal government. (p. 37)
