##### Action Research

> Action research is when people reflect on and improve their own work and their own situations by tightly linking their reflection with action and making their experience public, not only to the other participants, but also to other persons interested in the work and the situation (Altrichter et al, 1991). Data are collected by the participants themselves, they participate in the decision making, power is shared democratically, and members collaborate. Reflection is a key characteristic of action research. The practitioner-researchers self-reflect, self-evaluate, and self-manage the research autonomously and responsibly. More concisely, McClutcheon & Jung (1990) define action research as the inquiry teachers undertake to understand and improve their own practice.

> There is no ‘short answer’ to the question ‘What is action research?’. But let us say as a working definition, to be expanded on in this Introduction and indeed the rest of this volume, that action research is a participatory, democratic process con cerned with developing practical knowing in the pursuit of worthwhile human purposes, grounded in a participatory worldview which we believe is emerging at this historical moment. It seeks to bring together action and reflection, theory and practice, in participation with others, in the pursuit of prac tical solutions to issues of pressing concern to people, and more generally the flourishing of individual persons and their communities.

###### Action research (collaborative)

> DuFour (2010), as cited by Juma, Lehtomäki and Naukkarinen (2017), defines CAR as the process by which teachers jointly observe their situation, plan to take informed action to ameliorate undesirable actions and then critically reflect in and on their action. In this way, they can turn their schools into professional learning communities as they improve their classroom practices with a focus on learning for all. (DuFour et al., 2010: 12) (p. 4)

###### Action research (participatory)

> Participatory Action Research has been defined by Brydon-Miller and Maguire as 'a systematic approach to personal, organisational and structural transformation . . . that places human selfdetermination, the development of critical consciousness and positive social change as central goals' (Brydon-Miller and Maguire, 2009: 80). (p. 5)
