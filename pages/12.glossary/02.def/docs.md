### Education
> Education, properly speaking, is the process by which children, young people and adults are initiated into (1) forms of understanding that foster individual and collective selfexpression, (2) modes of action that foster individual and collective self-development, and (3) ways of relating to one another and the world that foster individual and collective selfdetermination, and that are, in these senses, oriented towards both the good for each person and the good for humankind.
